    "The banking industry is highly competitive, with fixed-term deposits being a popular product among customers. Fixed-term deposits require customers to deposit a certain amount of money, which can only be withdrawn after a specified period, in return for a fixed interest rate. To stay competitive, banks must continuously innovate to retain and attract new customers, often through targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric Bank has been running a series of telemarketing campaigns aimed at encouraging customers to subscribe to term deposits. However, these campaigns have not yielded the desired results. Despite extensive efforts, a significant number of customers are declining to make deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of 41,188 customers contacted, only 4,640 have subscribed to a term deposit, resulting in a conversion rate of approximately 11.27%. Each telemarketing call costs the bank 50 euros, leading to a total telemarketing expenditure of 2,059,400 euros. This substantial cost, coupled with the low conversion rate, indicates that the current telemarketing strategy is not as effective as it could be. The bank is incurring high expenses without achieving the desired return on investment.\n",

    "The primary challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a term deposit. By doing so, Electric Bank can focus its telemarketing efforts on high-potential customers, thereby increasing the conversion rate and reducing overall telemarketing costs\n",

    "The key evaluation metric for this project is **precision**. Precision is chosen because the cost of false positives (predicting that a client will subscribe when they actually wonâ€™t) is high. With precision, we can focus on ensuring that the clients we predict as likely to subscribe are indeed the ones who will do so, which directly supports the goal of reducing unnecessary telemarketing efforts."
